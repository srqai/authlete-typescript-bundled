This API generates an ID token.

<br>
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the [userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)
of the authorization server in order to generate an ID token. Before calling this API, a valid
response from `/auth/userinfo` API must be obtained. Then, call this API with the access token
contained in the response and the claims values of the user (subject) associated with the access
token. See **OK** written in the description of `/auth/userinfo` API for details.

The response from `/auth/userinfo/issue` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`
parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the
next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of
`action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.

**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete. In either case, from the
viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side. Therefore, the service
implementation should generate a response to the client application with HTTP status of "500 Internal
Server Error".

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**BAD_REQUEST**

When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
Authlete does not contain `token` parameter).

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**UNAUTHORIZED**

When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist, has
expired, or is not associated with any subject (= any user account).

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**FORBIDDEN**

When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not include the
`openid` scope.

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**JSON**

When the value of `action` is `JSON`, it means that the access token which the client application
presented is valid and an ID token was successfully generated in the format of JSON.

The userinfo endpoint implementation is expected to generate a response to the client application.
The content type of the response must be `application/json` and the response body must be an ID
token in JSON format.

The value of `responseContent` is the ID token in JSON format when `action` is `JSON`, so
a response to the client can be built like below.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

{responseContent}
```

**JWT**

When the value of `action` is `JWT`, it means that the access token which the client application
presented is valid and an ID token was successfully generated in the format of JWT (JSON Web Token)
([RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)).

The userinfo endpoint implementation is expected to generate a response to the client application.
The content type of the response must be `application/jwt` and the response body must be an ID
token in JWT format.

The value of `responseContent` is the ID token in JSON format when `action` is `JWT`, so a response
to the client can be built like below.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/jwt

{responseContent}
```

## issueForm

This API generates an ID token.

<br>
<details>
<summary>Description</summary>

This API is supposed to be called from within the implementation of the [userinfo endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfo)
of the authorization server in order to generate an ID token. Before calling this API, a valid
response from `/auth/userinfo` API must be obtained. Then, call this API with the access token
contained in the response and the claims values of the user (subject) associated with the access
token. See **OK** written in the description of `/auth/userinfo` API for details.

The response from `/auth/userinfo/issue` API has various parameters. Among them, it is `action`
parameter that the authorization server implementation should check first because it denotes the
next action that the authorization server implementation should take. According to the value of
`action`, the service implementation must take the steps described below.

**INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR**

When the value of `action` is `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`, it means that the request from the authorization
server implementation was wrong or that an error occurred in Authlete. In either case, from the
viewpoint of the client application, it is an error on the server side. Therefore, the service
implementation should generate a response to the client application with HTTP status of "500 Internal
Server Error".

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**BAD_REQUEST**

When the value of `action` is `BAD_REQUEST`, it means that the request from the client application
does not contain an access token (= the request from the authorization server implementation to
Authlete does not contain `token` parameter).

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**UNAUTHORIZED**

When the value of `action` is `UNAUTHORIZED`, it means that the access token does not exist, has
expired, or is not associated with any subject (= any user account).

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**FORBIDDEN**

When the value of `action` is `FORBIDDEN`, it means that the access token does not include the
`openid` scope.

The parameter `responseContent` returns a string which describes the error in the format of [RFC
6750](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6750) (OAuth 2.0 Bearer Token Usage) so the userinfo
endpoint implementation can use the value of `responseContent` as the value of`WWW-Authenticate`
header.

The following is an example response which complies with RFC 6750. Note that OpenID Connect Core
1.0 requires that an error response from userinfo endpoint comply with RFC 6750. See [5.3.3. UserInfo
Response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#UserInfoError) for details.

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
WWW-Authenticate: {responseContent}
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
```

**JSON**

When the value of `action` is `JSON`, it means that the access token which the client application
presented is valid and an ID token was successfully generated in the format of JSON.

The userinfo endpoint implementation is expected to generate a response to the client application.
The content type of the response must be `application/json` and the response body must be an ID
token in JSON format.

The value of `responseContent` is the ID token in JSON format when `action` is `JSON`, so
a response to the client can be built like below.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8

{responseContent}
```

**JWT**

When the value of `action` is `JWT`, it means that the access token which the client application
presented is valid and an ID token was successfully generated in the format of JWT (JSON Web Token)
([RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)).

The userinfo endpoint implementation is expected to generate a response to the client application.
The content type of the response must be `application/jwt` and the response body must be an ID
token in JWT format.

The value of `responseContent` is the ID token in JSON format when `action` is `JWT`, so a response
to the client can be built like below.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Cache-Control: no-store
Pragma: no-cache
Content-Type: application/jwt

{responseContent}
```

### Example Usage

<!-- UsageSnippet language="typescript" operationID="auth_userinfo_issue_api_form" method="post" path="/api/{serviceId}/auth/userinfo/issue" -->
```typescript
import { AutheleteBundled } from "authelete-bundled";

const autheleteBundled = new AutheleteBundled({
  security: {
    authlete: process.env["AUTHELETEBUNDLED_AUTHLETE"] ?? "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const result = await autheleteBundled.userInfoEndpoint.issueForm({
    serviceId: "<id>",
    requestBody: {
      clientLocked: true,
    },
  });

  console.log(result);
}

run();
```

### Standalone function

The standalone function version of this method:

```typescript
import { AutheleteBundledCore } from "authelete-bundled/core.js";
import { userInfoEndpointIssueForm } from "authelete-bundled/funcs/userInfoEndpointIssueForm.js";

// Use `AutheleteBundledCore` for best tree-shaking performance.
// You can create one instance of it to use across an application.
const autheleteBundled = new AutheleteBundledCore({
  security: {
    authlete: process.env["AUTHELETEBUNDLED_AUTHLETE"] ?? "",
  },
});

async function run() {
  const res = await userInfoEndpointIssueForm(autheleteBundled, {
    serviceId: "<id>",
    requestBody: {
      clientLocked: true,
    },
  });
  if (res.ok) {
    const { value: result } = res;
    console.log(result);
  } else {
    console.log("userInfoEndpointIssueForm failed:", res.error);
  }
}

run();
```
